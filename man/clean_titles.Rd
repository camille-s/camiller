clean_titles(
  x,
  cap_all = FALSE,
  split_case = TRUE,
  keep_running_caps = TRUE,
  space = "_",
  remove = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector}

\item{cap_all}{Logical: if \code{TRUE}, first letter of each word after splitting will be capitalized. If \code{FALSE}, only the first character of the string will be capitalized. Note that in order to balance this with respecting consecutive capital letters, such as from acronyms,}

\item{split_case}{Logical: if \code{TRUE}, consecutive lowercase-uppercase pairs will be treated as two words to be separated.}

\item{keep_running_caps}{Logical: if \code{TRUE}, consecutive uppercase letters will be kept uppercase.}

\item{space}{Character vector of characters and/or regex patterns that should be replaced with a space to separate words.}

\item{remove}{Character vector of characters and/or regex patterns that will be removed before any other operations; if \code{NULL}, nothing is removed.}
}
\value{
A character vector with each item newly formatted
}
\description{
This function combines several ways titles and names may need to be formatted. It's meant to be simple, yet flexible.
